; Cards sets can be traded in for troops. A card will be generated for each
; country, and will be assigned a random type each game. A set is defined as
; either: a) one of every type or b) all the same type. Wilds can only be
; combined with type b. The traded set must have more 'naturals' than wilds.
; Below you can change the set of card types and the number of wilds, both which
; comprise the deck. You can also define what each trade is worth up to some
; point. Once the trades array is exhausted every trade after will be worth a
; constant increment from the previous.

; Chromosomes determine the 'personality' of the AIs. Each is made up of an
; array of traits which can take on values from 0-2^8. Below is a short explanation
; of each trait. 0 means it does not posses the trait, and it will not be used
; during the decision making process for that AI.
; 
;   - offense:     [world domination speed]
;   - defence:     [building up troops]
;   - armies:      [higher number of troops]
;   - continents:  [continent bonuses]
;   - card_b:      [card bonus]
;   - troop_b:     [troop bonus]
;   - claim:       [country placement at game start]
;   - troops:      [troop placement at game start]
;   - takeover:    [overtaking opponents for cards]
;   - borders:     [fority borders]
; 
; Variable cps is used to track which AIs are used during gameplay/training.
; The traits var is used to track the nuber of elements in each chromosome.
; You can also control the mutation rate of the AI's DNA if they train and elect
; if you would like to perform elitism between generations of new AI's.
; If you elect to perform elitism you can also define the percentile of elitism.
; This is for easy extensibility in case one would like to adjust the internals
; of the AIs.
